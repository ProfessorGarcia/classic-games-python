# Classic Games in Python

This is a personal learning repository where I'm building classic games in Python to learn core programming and computer science concepts from the ground up.

Each project focuses on specific technical principles, structured to reinforce both theory and application. All code is written and pushed using terminal-based Git workflows, without reliance on GitHub's GUI.

## Goals

- Build foundational programming fluency
- Learn Python through hands-on projects
- Practice version control using Git and GitHub
- Strengthen understanding of terminal workflows
- Prepare for deeper dives into software engineering and technical pipelines

## Projects

| Game | Concepts Practiced |
|------|--------------------|
| [Guess the Number](./guess_the_number) | Input, loops, randomness, validation, nested logic |
| [Rock, Paper, Scissors](./rock_paper_scissors) | Lists, functions, game state, return values, input validation, best-of-N |

## Learning Themes

- Variables and data types
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Functions and return values
- Game logic structuring
- Terminal-based dev workflows
- Git and GitHub CLI usage
- Markdown and project documentation

## How to Run Games

Each project contains its own `main.py` script. From the terminal:

```bash
cd game_folder
python3 main.py
